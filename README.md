## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data visualization professional focused on building interactive dashboards and data-driven applications using Plotly and Dash. My work combines technical precision with a strong emphasis on usability and visual clarity, aiming to turn complex datasets into intuitive, insightful interfaces that help users explore, understand, and act on information.

With a background rooted in practical, real-world analytics, I specialize in creating web-based visual tools that serve both internal teams and external stakeholders. Iâ€™m especially drawn to Plotly for its expressive charting capabilities and to Dash for its ability to bring those charts to life in responsive, fully customized applicationsâ€”all using Python. These tools allow me to build dashboards that go beyond static visuals, offering users the ability to filter, drill down, and interact with data in meaningful ways.

On GitHub, I share projects, templates, and experiments that reflect both professional use cases and personal exploration. These often involve designing modular components, managing app state, handling user inputs, and integrating external APIs. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and documenting key decisions, so others can easily learn from or build upon the work.

Iâ€™m always looking to refine performance, improve user experience, and explore new ways to visualize data effectively. Whether itâ€™s optimizing callbacks, adding real-time updates, or extending dashboards with advanced layouts and interactivity, each project is an opportunity to deepen my understanding and push the limits of whatâ€™s possible with Dash and Plotly.

This profile represents my ongoing learning and work in the field of data visualization. I'm open to collaboration, conversation, and continuous improvement. If you're also passionate about making data more accessible and engaging through interactive design, youâ€™ll likely find something of interest here.
